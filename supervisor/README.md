# Description

Chef cookbook for supervisor, a python-based process manager.

**NOTE:** Make sure to rename this to `supervisor` if you clone it or 
incorporate it as a git submodule in your cookbooks.

## Recipes

### supervisor

Install and run supervisor. Configuration for processes you want to manage 
should be placed in separate files under 
`templates/<default>/etc/supervisor/{name}.conf.erb`. Because these are 
templates, you can add template variables depending on your setup.

Template examples included:

* etherpad-lite
* pgbouncer
* rabbitmq
* redis

Add an entry to your chef configuration for all configuration files 
you want to include and manage with supervisor:

    "supervisor": {
        "includes": ["etherpad-lite", "redis"]
    }

If you want to use template configuration files defined in a separate 
cookbook, use the `config_cookbook` option:

    "supervisor": {
        "config_cookbook": "custom-cookbook",
        "includes": ["redis"]
    }

This expects `cookbooks/custom-cookbook/templates/<default>/supervisor/redis.conf.erb`.
